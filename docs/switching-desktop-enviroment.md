Some people don't like Gnome. That's ok. Linux is about flexibility and preference.

This tutorial can be best divided into 3 steps.

1. Picking a Desktop Enviroment

[KDE Plasma](https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop) is similar to Cinnamon and Windows 7/Vista, based on simplicity and widget based desktops.

[Cinnamon](http://developer.linuxmint.com/) is the default Desktop Enviroment running on Linux Mint, also aimed torward previous Windows Users.

[Pantheon](https://elementary.io/) is made by Elementary OS and is based torward MacOS users and simplicity of UI.

[Budgie Desktop](https://budgie-desktop.org/home/) is the default DE on Solus, and is highly customizable and simple.

1. Installing it.

To install the desktop enviroment, simply lookup the command in this table.
